## Background

In this Jupyter Notebook, I use Python and Pandas quantitative analytical tools to identify the top-performing portfolios based on volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. Through the analysis and visualization of these key metrics, I achieved three main objectives:

* Read in and Wrangle Returns Data - Preparing the Data
* Determine Success of Each Portfolio - Conducting Quantitative Analysis
* Choose and Evaluate Custom Portfolio - Building a Custom Portfolio (including data preparation and quantitative analysis)

## Read and Clean Data

Read each CSV file into a DataFrame using Pandas. Next, clean the data by converting dates to a DateTimeIndex, identifying and removing all null values, and adjusting data types as necessary. Finally, concatenate all the DataFrames into a single DataFrame to perform quantitative analysis and determine if any portfolios outperform the S&P 500.

## Shape Ratios

The Sharpe Ratios plot indicates that BERSHIRE HATHAWAY INC provides the best risk-return profile, while PAULSON & CO INC presents the least favorable risk-return characteristics.

## Conclusion

After completing the quantitative analysis of various portfolios, I recommend including the S&P 500 and BERSHIRE HATHAWAY INC in our firm's fund offerings.
